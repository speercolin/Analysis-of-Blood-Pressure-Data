	<p>Blood pressure is an important measurement of your cardiovascular health. High blood pressure is linked to both heart disease and stroke which are two leading causes of death in the United States.
	According to the CDC, almost one-third of Americans have high blood pressure and greater than half of Americans don't have control over it.
	Our blood pressure is measured using two different numbers, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
	While both are important, systolic blood pressure is widely used as the primary reading for diagnosis.
	Systolic blood pressure is define as the force produced by your heart as it pumps out blood to your body.
	I will be choosing to isolate and look at systolic blood pressure along in this comparison for these reasons.</p>

		<p>The scatter plot above visualizes the correlation between blood pressure and alcohol consumption in the US.
		Using the regression line as a guide, a positive correlation can be seen between the two variables.</p>

		<p>After analyzing the plot above, I believe there is a positive correlation between blood pressure and alcohol consumption.
		I conducted a Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Test between the two variables.
		The correlation coefficient calculated in our test is 0.66, which proves a strong association between blood pressure and alcohol consumption in the United States.</p>
